	<h2>The story so far</h2>
	<p>Reality shows are meant to evoke emotions, create drama, and somewhere strengthen bonds among the contestants. 
Hi-fi Calendar Girls is all these and more. </p>
<p>Right from its inception, the buzz was that this reality show will be an exhibit of grit and determination, of talent and showbiz. And, we are proud to say the show has been every bit of these so far and in some cases, it is moving beyond to prove that it is a show with a difference. </p>
<p>Here, we try to capture and bring before you a portrait of what has happened, what has been happening and what is going to happen.</p>

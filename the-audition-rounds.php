<h2>The Audition Round - Episodes 1 &amp; 2 </h2>

<p>December 6 – 7 2013 saw hundreds of beautiful and talented girls make way to the ferry “Alfresco” for the auditions of Hi-fi Calendar Girl 2014. They had come from various parts of the Northeast including Tripura, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, and of course from all across Assam. </p>
<p>When the judges – Garima S. Garg, Sukalpa Das and Bhabajeet Choudhury - walked in, there were loud cheers.   
The auditions began with the judges asking the contestants to walk the ramp. This was followed by a personal interview round, where the contestants were judged for their intelligence, wit and presence of mind. </p>
<p>The auditions spanned across two days. The second day saw 24 girls make it to the reality show. The excitement among them was contagious and they were all set to put their best foot forward at the show.</p>
